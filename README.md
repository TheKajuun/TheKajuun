# Hello, I'm C. Aaron McIntyre

Currently pursuing a new AAS in Cybersecurity from Montgomery College, where I am gaining hands-on practical experience while polishing up my skill set.

## Objective
While I have a wide range of capabilities, my recent focus has been in cybersecurity, and I am eager to complete my transition into this field. My best fit professionally is likely going to be in a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Security Analyst, where the complex tools involved complement my diverse background most effectively.
