Locality: Montgomery County, MD, near Washington, DC <br>
Currently pursuing a new AAS in Cybersecurity from Montgomery College, gaining hands-on practical experience while polishing up on my preferred skill set.

<h3>Objective</h3>
While I have a extremely wide range of capabilities, my passion and focus is squarely on cybersecurity, being eager to complete my transition into this field. My best fit professionally is likely going to be in a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Security Analyst, where the complex tools and detail oriented responsibilities complement my diverse background most effectively.

<h3>Projects</h3>
Title: <b><a href="https://github.com/TheKajuun/Security-Lab">Layered Network Defense using pfSense-Hosted IDS and Nessus Vulnerability Scanning</a></b><br>
Goal: <b><u>Demonstrate a two-layer defensive architecture</b></u> by combining real-time detection with scheduled vulnerability assessments to reduce overall network risk and align with CISSP best practices for defense-in-depth. Included within my security lab are:<br>
•	A pfSense firewall running a network IDS (Snort and Suricata) to detect and optionally block malicious traffic in real time.<br>
•	A Nessus vulnerability scanner to proactively discover misconfigurations, missing patches, and other known vulnerabilities on local network hosts.<br>
•	Other devices, intended for flexibility of usage for a home security lab<br>
<br>
My home security lab setup includes two Kali Linux VirtualBox VMs (Kali Blue and Kali Red), one Ubuntu Linux VM Webserver, one Metasploitable 2 VM, one Windows 11 VM, and the pfSense firewall VM to securely separate them from the rest of my devices.

<h3>Labs</h3>
Title: <b><a href="https://github.com/TheKajuun/Python-HTTP-Server">Wireshark: Capturing Cleartext Login with Local HTTP Server</a></b><br>
Goal: Capture and quickly find cleartext credentials using a minimalist python based web server to quickly show what Wireshark can and cannot capture

This will be expanded, it simply takes a while to properly sanitize the many labs I have already completed for public visibility.
